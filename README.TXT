Movie Tickets Booking System is an efficient booking system for movie lovers as it allows the user to choose their favourite genres which results in less time consumption. It also allows the user to add or remove seats if mistakenly booked at the First attempt. And also, there is an option of buying snacks and beverages beforehand only which gives our customer satisfactory experience.  
The project “Online Movie Ticket Booking System” is dedicated to the general requirements of multiplex theatres. The main objective of the project is to create an Online Movie Ticket Booking processing that allows customers to know about new movies, their schedules, cinema locations, class and ticket price etc. In the booking process when customer selects his city then cinemas of that city are filtered. In next step he/she selects his desired cinema where he/she wish to see movie, then selects movie and other details like show date, show time, class and no of tickets. Based on given parameters a graphical layout of seat status is visible to the customer. Now customer can select his desired seat location and number of seats. The Administrator will be able to see all booked and cancelled tickets. At last this system will display all the items that were booked by the user and also the grand sum or final bill that should be paid by the user.
All over, this system can also be implemented as a software and the Changes in software can be easily accommodated. The addition and deletion of the modules in software can be easily adjusted. This project has a lot of scope for further enhancement too. This project can save money and efforts in managing the record, just a mouse click can make the task easy and faster.
